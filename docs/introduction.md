# Introduction

OrganicJS provides an MVC style development approach using ExpressJS. We all love the unopinionated flexibility of ExpressJS but it often ends in mess as the code base grows.

Unlike other heavy-weight frameworks, OrganicJS aims to remain just a thin layer on top of ExpressJS while keeping all its goodies so that it may help you eliminate the repititive boilerplate.

## Zero Learning Curve

If you already know ExpressJS, you will feel right at home.
